# NetworkProgramming-ChatServer

## Description
This project is part of a simple network-based chat application

## Server description

The ChatServer program needs run first. Itâ€™s main task is to create a server, listen for connecting clients and handling all messages. 
Server is created in the Main class where a main (runner) method is located. User is given an option to pick up a port number on which the created server will run.
Port number can be selected within range 5000 up to 65 535. The server will start after the user selects a valid port number. 
User is returned to correct his selection if the entered input contains either number smaller than 5000, bigger than 65 535, or any other Java data type than Integer. 
After this configuration, the server is ready to receive incoming connections. 
This server is a multithreaded server therefore it can handle communication with multiple clients. 
Each new incoming connection represented by new client creates new ClientThread object which runs concurrently with other connected clients.
